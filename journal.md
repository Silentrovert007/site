# Personal site

## List of pages after the project is completed:
1. **Home** - Just a quick intro and information about myself 
2. **About** - Quick information about myself and skills
3. **Resume** - complete academic and professonal background
4. **Portfolio** - page dedicated to the projects made 
5. **Blog** - Personal Blog

## Progress Tracking:

before the creation of the table below, several commits have been made. the home section is done, the cv content is already set. Now
for the resume, I think I'll make some changes in the styling.
